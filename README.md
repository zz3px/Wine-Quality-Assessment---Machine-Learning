# Wine-Quality-Assessment---Machine-Learning
The data set is on white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine with 4898 observations and are collected 
on 12 different properties of the wines one of which is the response variable, Quality, based on sensory data, 
and the rest 11 variables are on chemical properties of the wines including density, acidity etc. All chemical 
properties of wines are continuous variables. Quality is an ordinal variable with possible ranking from 1 (worst)
to 10 (best). Each variety of wine is tasted by three tasters and the final rank assigned is the median rank given 
by the tasters.
